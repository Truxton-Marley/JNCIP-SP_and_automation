# JNCIP-SP and Python Automation Studies

This repository serves as a study aid for the JNCIP-SP certification as well as a playground for experimenting with various Python network automation tools, such as Netmiko, PyATS, NAPALM, Nornir, and Ansible. The code is intended purely for learning and practice purposes and is not designed to be up to production standard in any way, but to serve as a sandbox for testing.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To prepare for the [JNCIP-SP certification exam](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/tracks/service-provider-routing-switching/jncip-sp.html) by implementing and testing relevant networking scenarios.
- To explore and compare different Python-based network automation tools.

All labs are on EVE-NG using a combination of vMX and Cisco IOS. Jupyter Lab is used to document notes, configs, and outputs. The notebooks also function as my study notes for the exam.
