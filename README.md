# JNCIP-SP and Python Automation Studies

This is a small repo to help me study for my JNCIP-SP exam and practice different automation options in Python, namely Netmiko, PyATS, Napalm, Nornir, Ansible. The code is just for learning/practice and does not aim to be at production level - more of a playground to test in :)

All labs are run on Eve-NG for now with a mixture of vMXs. I intend to run most the code from Jupyter lab so I can use the notes, configs, and outputs to study for the exam.
